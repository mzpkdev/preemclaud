# Arasaka

A GitHub Action that wraps [`anthropics/claude-code-action`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action) and
exposes `system_prompt` as a first-class input — giving you full control over Claude's behavior without touching
upstream code.

## Concept

Upstream's action hardcodes a 40KB behavioral preamble that tells Claude how to think, format responses, and structure
its work. There's no official way to replace it — only `custom_instructions`, which appends text after the preamble
rather than replacing it.

Arasaka solves this by keeping the entire GitHub infrastructure layer (GraphQL data fetching, MCP servers, branch
management, comment tracking) while swapping out the one thing that matters: the prompt. Our custom prompt builder
writes only structured context data — PR body, comments, changed files, branch names — and leaves all behavioral
instructions to `system_prompt`.

```yaml
- uses: mzpkdev/preemclaud/arasaka@v1
  with:
    claude_code_oauth_token: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
    system_prompt: |
      You are a terse code reviewer. Focus on correctness and security.
      Never suggest stylistic changes. Be blunt.
```

```

### The submodule

`upstream/` is a pinned checkout of `anthropics/claude-code-action`. It provides everything except the prompt and the
top-level entrypoint, both of which Arasaka overrides:

| Upstream file                | Status                               | Reason                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/create-prompt/index.ts` | Replaced by `src/prompt/index.ts`    | Contains the 40KB behavioral preamble              |
| `src/entrypoints/run.ts`     | Replaced by `src/entrypoints/run.ts` | Calls `createPrompt` — can't be imported around it |
| Everything else              | Used as-is                           | GitHub API layer, MCP servers, SDK runner          |

To update the upstream pin:

```bash
cd arasaka/upstream
git fetch origin
git checkout <new-tag-or-sha>
cd ../..
git add arasaka/upstream
git commit -m "chore(arasaka): bump upstream to <version>"
```

### The v1 branch

`uses: mzpkdev/preemclaud/arasaka@v1` resolves to the `v1` orphan branch, which holds pre-built bundles so consumers pay
zero runtime overhead (no `bun install`, no TypeScript compilation).

The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release-arasaka.yml`) runs automatically on every push to `main` that touches
`arasaka/`. It:

1. Bundles `src/entrypoints/run.ts` → `run.js`
1. Bundles each MCP server separately (they're spawned as child processes — must be separate files)
1. Patches `action.yml` to point at the bundled paths and strips the `bun install` step
1. Force-pushes an orphan commit to the `v1` branch under `arasaka/`

The v1 branch layout mirrors what GitHub expects for `uses: .../arasaka@v1`:

```
arasaka/
├── action.yml
├── run.js
├── src/
│   ├── mcp/           ← bundled MCP servers (.ts extension kept for path compat)
│   └── entrypoints/   ← cleanup + post-inline-comments
└── scripts/
    └── git-push.sh
```

## Usage

```yaml
- uses: mzpkdev/preemclaud/arasaka@v1
  with:
    # Required: one of these
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    claude_code_oauth_token: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_ACCESS_TOKEN }}

    # The whole point
    system_prompt: |
      Your instructions here. This is the complete behavioral contract —
      no upstream preamble will be injected before or after it.

    # Optional: skip Claude Code reinstall (useful with preemclaud)
    path_to_claude_code_executable: ${{ env.CLAUDE_BIN }}
```

All other inputs (`trigger_phrase`, `base_branch`, `branch_prefix`, `use_commit_signing`, etc.) are pass-throughs to
upstream — see `action.yml` for the full list.

## Reusable Workflows

Three independent reusable workflows, each handling one concern. Consumers wire their own triggers and cron schedules.

### Queue

Creates implementation issues from codebase analysis. Labels created issues with `ready_label` so the develop workflow
can discover them.

```yaml
name: Queue
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 6 * * 1" # Monday 6am
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  queue:
    uses: mzpkdev/preemclaud/arasaka/workflows/queue.yml@v1
    secrets: inherit
```

| Input              | Default         | Purpose                                    |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `ready_label`      | `arasaka:ready` | Label applied to created issues            |
| `queue_max_issues` | `1`             | Max issues the queue planner opens per run |
| `base_branch`      | _repo default_  | Base branch override                       |

### Develop

Discovers labeled issues and implements them. Removes the ready label before starting work to prevent re-processing.
Also supports direct `@arasaka` comment triggers for immediate work.

```yaml
name: Develop
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 */6 * * *" # every 6 hours
  workflow_dispatch:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  develop:
    uses: mzpkdev/preemclaud/arasaka/workflows/develop.yml@v1
    secrets: inherit
```

| Input            | Default         | Purpose                                           |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `trigger_phrase` | `@arasaka`      | Comment trigger for direct issue / PR-thread work |
| `ready_label`    | `arasaka:ready` | Label to query for cron-based issue discovery     |
| `branch_prefix`  | `claude/`       | Prefix used for generated work branches           |
| `base_branch`    | _repo default_  | Base branch override                              |
| `max_issues`     | `5`             | Max issues to pick up per cron run                |

### Review

Automatic pull request review on PR events.

```yaml
name: Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, ready_for_review, reopened]

jobs:
  review:
    uses: mzpkdev/preemclaud/arasaka/workflows/review.yml@v1
    secrets: inherit
```

No additional inputs — review context comes from the PR event payload.

## Internal Presets

The reusable workflow is backed by preset composite actions stored in `arasaka/actions/`:

- `queue` for autonomous issue creation
- `review` for automatic PR review
- `develop` for same-run issue implementation

These are versioned with the main Arasaka release, but the reusable workflow above is the intended public entrypoint.

### With preemclaud

If the calling repo has preemclaud installed on the runner, pass its binary directly to skip the default Claude Code
install step:

```yaml
- name: Install preemclaud
  run: |
    npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mzpkdev/preemclaud/main/install.sh | bash
    echo "CLAUDE_BIN=$(which claude)" >> $GITHUB_ENV

- uses: mzpkdev/preemclaud/arasaka@v1
  with:
    claude_code_oauth_token: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
    path_to_claude_code_executable: ${{ env.CLAUDE_BIN }}
    system_prompt: ...
```

This is required when your settings use preemclaud-specific model names — the stock binary won't recognize them and will
exit immediately.
